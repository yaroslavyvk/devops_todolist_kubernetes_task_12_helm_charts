# Django ToDo list

This is a todo list web application with basic features of most web apps, i.e., accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. To do this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Try it out by installing the requirements (the following commands work only with Python 3.8 and higher, due to Django 4):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is http://localhost:8000):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you can browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).

## Task

Create a kubernetes manifest for a pod which will containa ToDo app container:

1. Fork this repository.
1. Use `kind` to spin up a cluster from a `cluster.yml` configuration file.
1. Inspect Nodes for Labels and Taints
1. Taint nodes labeled with `app=mysql` with `app=mysql:NoSchedule`
1. Create a helm chart named `todoapp` inside a `helm-chart` directory
1. `todoapp` helm chart requirements:
    1. Namespace name should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Use `.Chart.Name` as a prefix for all resources names
    1. Secrets should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Secrets `data` should be popualted by a `range` function
    1. Inside the deployment use `range` to map secrets as environment variables
    1. Resources requests and limits should controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. RollingUpdate parameters should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Image repository and tag should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Deployment node affinity parameters should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file (key and values)
    1. `hpa` min and max replicas should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. `hpa` average CPU and Memory utilization should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. `pv` capacity should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. `pvc` requests storage should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Service Account Name inside both `Deployment` and all rbac objects should be controld from a `values.yaml` file
1. Creata a sub-chart called `mysql` inside a `charts` directory of the `todoapp` helm chart
1. `mysql` helm chart requirements:
    1. Namespace name should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Use `.Chart.Name` as a prefix for all resources names
    1. Secrets should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Secrets `data` should be popualted by a `range` function
    1. StateFulSet's Replicas should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Image repository and tag should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. `pvc` requests storage should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Affinity and Toleration parameters should be controlled from a `values.yaml` file
    1. Resource requests and limits should controlled from a `values.yaml` file
1. `bootstrap.sh`containe all commands to deploy prerequsites and the `todoapp` helm chart
1. `README.md` should have instructuions on how to validate the changes
1. Create PR with your changes and attach it for validation on a platform.
